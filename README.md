## SE361: Intro to Software Engineering

### Project Above:

Above is a sample 'Workflow Management System' created to satisfy functional requirements outlined [here](https://github.com/noahmm35/SE361/blob/main/WorkflowOutline.pdf).

It is also worth noting that this was not a solo venture as this was a group project worked on by myself, Noah Baker, Gavin Strickland, and Sophie Fischer over the course of the Spring 2023 semester.

Finally, also attached are the presentations that we gave every sprint (roughly 2 weeks) so that you can see progress made along the way!
